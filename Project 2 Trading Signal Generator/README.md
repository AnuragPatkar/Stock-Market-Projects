# Trading Signal Generator
This project builds a simple program that analyzes basic stock metrics and generates buy, sell, or hold signals based on user-defined thresholds.

The program will:

* Accept input for a stock's metrics (price, moving averages, RSI, volume)

* Apply simple trading rules using comparison and logical operators

* Check for technical patterns like Golden/Death Cross

* Generate a trading recommendation with explanation
