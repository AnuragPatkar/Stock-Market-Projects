    "This project creates a simple Python program that helps users track and analyze their stock portfolio performance. We'll implement a tool that calculates key metrics for each stock position and provides an overall portfolio summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, we'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Collect user input for stock positions\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Calculate position values and performance metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Display a comprehensive portfolio summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project applies fundamental Python concepts including variables, data types, operators, and input/output operations – core building blocks for algorithmic trading systems."
